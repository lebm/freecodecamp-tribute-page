# Yet another Einstein tribute page

This repository is a freeCodeCamp challenge: build a tribute page.
I'm using the Atom editor on my notebook to create the page.
I also will publish this page at codepen.io.
I started using codepen with the supplied Bootstrap (version 4.0.0 alpha I think), but a few things didn' t work properly.
I've installed Bootstrap 3.3.7 on my notebook, and everything worked as expected, so I changed the supplied codepen Bootstrap to version 3.3.7 using the link https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.min.css in the CSS configuration.
