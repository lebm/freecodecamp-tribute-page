                        <h2>Some Facts About Einstein:</h2>
                        <h3>A resumed chronology</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>1879</strong> - Date of birth: 14 March 1879</li>
                            <li><strong>1880</strong> - In 1880, his family moved to Munich.</li>
                            <li><strong>1896</strong> - Enrolled in the four-year mathematics and physics teaching diploma program at the Zürich Polytechnic.</li>
                            <li><strong>1900</strong> - Awarded the Zürich Polytechnic teaching diploma.</li>
                            <li><strong>1901</strong> - Acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901 and secured a job in Bern at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office, as an assistant examiner.</li>
                            <li><strong>1905</strong> - In 1905, Einstein published four papers in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annalen_der_Physik" target="_blank">"Annalen der Physik"</a> journal: Photoelectric effect, Brownian motion, Special relativity, and Mass–energy equivalence. These four articles contributed substantially to the foundation of modern physics and changed views on space, time, mass, and energy. Today, we call 1905 as the "Annus Mirabilis" (miracle year) because of these Einstein's work.</li>
                            <li><strong>1915</strong> - Published his General Theory of Relativity, i.e., his theory of gravity. Nowadays, every GPS device must take into account the effects of this theory to work properly.</li>
                            <li><strong>1921</strong> - Received the Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelectric_effect" target="_blank">photoelectric effect</a>"</li>
                            <li><strong>1955</strong> - On 17 April 1955, he died in Princeton Hospital at the age of 76, having continued to work until near the end.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Curiosities</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Einstein did not want to call his most famous theory 'relativity,' instead, he wanted to call it <a href="https://www.quora.com/If-everything-is-relative-is-relativity-absolute" target="_blank">'The theory of invariants'</a>, i.e., the theory of absolutes.</li>
                            <li>Apparently, Einstein said the phrase: <cite>“The most powerful force in the universe is compound interest.”</cite> Although interesting, some people says it is just an urban legend.</li>
                            <li>Probably the most famous equation is the mass-energy equivalence, i.e., <math><i>E=mc<sup>2</sup></i></math>.</li>
                            <li>The gravitational waves predicted by Einstein in 1916 was only detected in 2016.</li>
                            <li>The lay public know Einstein  by his relativity theories (special and general), but he won the Nobel prize for his work on photoelectric effect, a phenomenon that has a lot of useful applications.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>This is just a tiny list of Einstein achievements, there is much more to know about him. To start, take a look at his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" target="_blank">Wikipedia entry</a></p>
